# MSP430FR2311 Breakout board

The files in this folder contain the schematic, PCB, and Gerber files for an MSP430FR2311 breakout board meant to be placed into a Breadboard. The pins on the headers connecting to the breadboard map to the pins on that side of the microcontroller in order. The PCB is complete with bulk and decoupling capacitors for handling power supply ripple, as well as a pullup resistor and debouncing capacitor for the ~RST input.
